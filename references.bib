abstract = {Online music radios, such as Last.fm and Douban.fm, which provide users with free music, have gained much popularity in recent years. In online music radios, music recommendation plays a central role in recommending the most relevant music to users who are most likely to listen to. Different from traditional on-demand music service, online music radios have only users&#x27; listening records instead of users&#x27; ratings, which make it difficult to give an accurate recommendation. In this paper, we use a pairwise ranking based collaborative filtering method which performs well on one-class collaborative filtering. We future extend our model by considering users&#x27; artist preference, which based on the assumption that users who have listened tracks belonging to the same artist are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with few ratings. Experimental results on real-world data sets show the performance of our method.},

abstract = {Music streaming platforms enable people to access millions of tracks using computers and mobile devices. The latter allow users consume different music during different activities. Both, the sheer amount of music and the mobile access to music makes music organization an interesting topic for multimedia researchers. Assisting users to organize their music and make the music they like easily available in the right moment, contributes to increased usability of music streaming platforms. To get a deeper understanding of how users organize music nowadays, we analyze user-created playlists crawled from the music streaming platform Spotify. Using this new data set we find an explanation of differences in the playlists using audio features and based on this compute playlist clusters. We find that 91% of all users create at least one playlist in the “feel good music”-cluster and classical music or rap music can be considered as niche music with respect to the number of playlists, however not as niche music when considering the number of users. To foster research in this field, we make our analysis tool publicly available.},
